# Data Mining in Business - ISA 491

## Course Description:
Analysis of large data sets related to business is the focus. Topics such as cluster analysis, market basket analysis, tree diagrams, logistic regression, neural nets, model evaluation and application will be presented and implemented using current data mining software.

## List of Languages Used:
- RStudio
- RMarkdown

## List of Topics Covered:
- Data Exploration and Preparation
- Dimension Reduction
- Evaluating Predictive Performance
- Decision Trees
- Logisitc Regression
- Neural Networks
- Random Forest
- Data Partitioning (Training/Test)

## Final Project Description:
The director of Enrollment Research and Analysis, has given us a task of assigning a probability of
leaving the university to incoming all freshman (probability of not being retained). The university
definition of retention rate is the proportion of students who returned for a third semester. Thus the
retention rate reported in US News and World Report is the percentage of students who start as typical
freshman and returned for the first semester of their sophomore year. Note that “return” means that
the student was enrolled in class on October 15 of that semester. If a student left Miami after that date
they would be counted as being “retained”. This will give Miami information as to which students to
give extra attention to upon admittance.

### Final Project Goals
- Gain experience working with a real problem with data collected by a real system (Banner Web)
- Gain experience “data wrangling”.
- To walk through the predictive modeling process virtually unguided and present a result.
- Imputed variables as well as indicators when appropriate.
- Properly coded response variable (1=left Miami, 0=still here).
- Properly collapsed categorical variables
- Properly created dummy variables
- Only the variables that will be used in the modeling process
- No redundant variables
- Proper dimension reduction techniques applied
- Merging outside data
