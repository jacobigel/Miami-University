# GAP Analysis

Interest lies in determining whether there is a difference in the average purchase total (i.e. the average dollar value of a customerâ€™s purchase) between promotion versions. Knowing that the average purchase amount might vary between weekdays the GAP ran each condition on each weekday. The control was no offer.

```{r}
df<-read.csv("/Users/jacobigel/Desktop/School/ISA365-A/Datasets/gap.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

head(df, 40)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

df_long <- df %>% pivot_longer(
  c("A", "B","control"),
  names_to = "Version", 
  values_to = "Purchase"
)

df_long$Version <- as.factor(df_long$Version)
df_long


```
```{r}
mod<-aov(Purchase~Version+Day, data=df_long)
summary(mod)
```
```{r}
qqnorm(mod$residuals)
qqline(mod$residuals)
```
```{r}
df_long$residuals<-mod$residuals
boxplot(df_long$residuals~df_long$Version)
```
```{r}
TukeyHSD(mod)
```


```{r}
boxplot(df_long$Purchase~df_long$Version, xlab = "Version", ylab = "Purchase Total Amount")
```
```{r}
boxplot(df_long$Purchase~df_long$Day, xlab = "Day", ylab = "Purchase Total Amount")
```
