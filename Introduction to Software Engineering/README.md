## Final Project Description:
The amount of applications, both web and mobile, is growing at an incredible
rate. Many platforms have their own “stores”, such as the Apple Store, Chrome
Web Store, or Google Play. These are useful when one knows exactly what they
are looking for and for what device. However, there is no single location (library)
for both application users, developers, and researchers to browse through,
compare, purchase, and discuss applications. For example, if I wanted to
contribute to the “Alarm Clock App” domain by creating a new application and
wanted to see all “Alarm Clock” applications in existence, it would be very
onerous to amalgamate all that information for me to consider. <br />

In this project, we will be creating a repository of applications. That is, you can
view it as a library of applications that is sortable and filterable based on different
criteria. <br />

The Meta-App is different from platform-specific stores in that it provides more
information, includes user discussions, is user-driven, and allows cross-platform
comparison.

### Final Project Goals
- The name Meta-App is merely a codename for this project. You must come up with your own name for your specific project implementation and for your project team.
- Without logging in, a user should be able to 1) view, 2) sort, and 3) filter all the applications in the repository.
- Each application (entry) in the repository should contain, AT LEAST, the name of the application; a description; the organization; the platform(s) and version(s) it can be installed to; an external link to the respective stores; and the price.
- Additional features will arise (from the customer) as the project continues. {If you do another domain other than Apps, the customers will give you replacement attributes}
- There should be a consistent search bar on every page that will do a string search (and sort?) on all of the applications’ respective fields.
- Applications are added to the repository by having users submitting a request form to add an application. This must include an external link to the platform specific application page that must be verified (manually at this point) by a System Administrator (Admin). Thus, requests are is standby until approved by an Admin.
- Admins should have access to an outstanding request page where they can see all the submitted application requests. Admins can respond and take action on them (accept or deny, both with related comments). Moderators are Users with the ability to moderate a comment section (delete posts) for each included app. They do not have the same access as Administrators. Administrators can be moderators, however. All can be Users. Users must login in order to post on the forums.
- The backend of the repository and user login information must be persisted. That is, saved so it can be used long-term. We do not require a formal database, but you may use one if you think that is best.
- The Meta-App interface should be as simple as possible and adhere to common style and user interface guidelines. The repository interface should closely mimic the repository interface provided by other repository applications.
