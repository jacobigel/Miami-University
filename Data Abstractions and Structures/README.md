# Data Abstractions and Structures - CSE 274
> Fall Semester 2022-2023

## Course Description:
Abstract data types and their implementation as data structures using object-oriented programming. Use of object-oriented principles in the selection and analysis of various ADT implementations. Sequential and linked storage representations: lists, stacks, queues, and tables. Nonlinear data structures: trees and graphs. Recursion, sorting, searching, and algorithm complexity
